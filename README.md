# HSI-MSI HAIHONG DATASET

The HSI-MSI HAIHONG DATASET is used for for Hyperspectral and Multispectral Images Collaborative Classification.

## Dataset Introduction

The HSI-MSI Haihong dataset includes both HSI and MSI data. The HSI data is sourced from the ’Zhuhai No.1’ hyperspectral satellite (OHS), whilethe MSI data is sourced from the ’Zhuhai No.1’ video satellite (OVS). Among them, the OVS satellite has a spatial resolution of 0.9 meters, while the OHS satellite has a spatial resolution of 10 meters, a spectral resolution of 2.5 nm, and covers a wavelength range from 400 nm to 1000 nm . The dataset collected RS imagery from the Dianchi Lake Basin in Kunming and the adjacent Haihong Wetland. In this area, a large number of dawn redwood have been planted along Dianchi Lake, playing a significant role in purifying the lake’s water quality and protecting the ecological environment. To maintain temporal consistency and avoid the deterioration of pixel misalignment, this study utilizes temporally similar data for analysis. Additionally, by using ENVI for image registration and cropping of the same coverage area, the HSI are upsampled to match the spatial resolution of the MSI. The HSI has 32 bands, while the MSI has 3 bands, and the resulting image size is 1000 × 1500 pixels. 

This dataset is continuously being organized and expanded with the aim of advancing the field of multi-source remote sensing image classification.
